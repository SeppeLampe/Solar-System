# Solar-System

Welcome!

This project creates an adjustable Solar System model in Python. This group project was written by Petio Todorov and Seppe Lampe for the course 'Advanced Programming Concepts' at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. In this project we made a physics-based model of the solar system. Instructions for running this program are found in [main.py](https://github.com/SeppeLampe/Solar-System/blob/master/Main.py) and in [our report](https://github.com/SeppeLampe/Solar-System/blob/master/Report.pdf). Below are demonstrations of the project.

Earth and moon:

Stony planets (the blue-white line represents Earth (blue) and Moon (white). The orbits look circular but are slightly ellipsoidal, as in reality, due to the physics-based nature of the simulation:
