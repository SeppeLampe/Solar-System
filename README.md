# Solar-System

Welcome!

This project creates an adjustable Solar System model in Python. This group project was written by Petio Todorov and Seppe Lampe for the course 'Advanced Programming Concepts' at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. In this project we made a physics-based model of the solar system. Instructions for running this program are found in [main.py](https://github.com/SeppeLampe/Solar-System/blob/master/Main.py) and in [our report](https://github.com/SeppeLampe/Solar-System/blob/master/Report.pdf). Below are some demonstrations of the project.
